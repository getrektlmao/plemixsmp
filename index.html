           Perhaps the quintessential CS:GO map, Dust II has been a classic since its original release. The map captures the essence of CS and in this new release we wanted to honor its pure form while buffing away the jagged edges. Our goals for the map updates were:
            <ul>
                <li>Improve player readability throughout the map
                <li>Refine movement around the world including cover
                <li>Upgrade the visuals to be in line with modern maps
            </ul>
            Dust II is now available! Thank you for your feedback while the map was in beta. Below you’ll find a few highlights of what has changed. Feel free to use the sliders to track the differences.        </div>

            A number of overly dark spots in Tunnels have been addressed with natural light pouring in by way of a crumbling, torn away roof. The broken down car at the bomb site has also been moved a bit, allowing a more free player flow around it. The break in the wall, 'Window', has now been widened and the movement brushes around it relaxed. Just beyond this, Scaffold has been simplified with no more metal pipes to stand in the way of your next frag. In addition, a few electrical poles have been moved outside the playspace as to simplify unnecessary distractions while not taking away visual fidelity.        </div>

            The broken down cars at A are now one car with increased player flow around and on it. Experienced players will now not have to worry about whether they’re going to get hung up and newbs won’t wonder if they’re going to get burned. Annoying physics based detritus props have also been replaced with more predictable static prop detail such as weeds and rocks.        </div>

            A number of other dark doorways have been adjusted and 'neither here nor there' door cover has been eliminated. With fewer alcoves to get hung up on, you will have more time to sweat the important stuff.        </div>

        <div class="copy">
            While Dust II’s gameplay doesn’t seem to age, the art needed a good sandblasting. The Bombsite B section of the map is now a historic Kasbah under restoration while Bombsite A is a bazaar and hotel. The texture resolution has been quadrupled and a North African prop set established for all you community mappers to use. Now, the bad news is the 2 pizza parlors are no more. The good news: they’ve been replaced by 2 dentist offices. Coincidence? Probably not.        </div>

            The infamous Leet Krew, classic villains of Dust II and previously known as “Durah,” have received an overhaul to match their updated environment. These T's feature upgraded character models, redesigned at high resolution to be more identifiable, cohesive, and iconic; hardened veterans of countless rounds of CS and still hell-bent on world domination. You'll notice a few of the Leet Krew are regulars at the new Salon De Coiffeur.        </div>

            Dust II has evolved over the years into one of the most balanced and iconic CS:GO maps around. With this in mind, we set out to refine it further rather than performing a wholesale redesign. Your beta feedback has helped us determine next steps. What would you like to see next as the map continues its evolution? We still want to hear from you.        </div>
